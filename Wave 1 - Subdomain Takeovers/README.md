# Project Resonance Wave 1 - Subdomain Takeovers

> Blog: https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/project-resonance-wave-1.html

Our first wave was a research on subdomain takeovers or more precisely misconfigured CNAME records. We are releasing a dataset of top subdomain names that we found vulnerable to takeover. 

> __NOTE:__ This list is sorted in descending order according to the frequencies of the takeovers, which signifies the topmost vulnerable subdomain name was *"www"*. The original subdomains list is around 90k, but we decided to filter out the rare ones.

Dataset(s):
- [top-vulnerable-subdomain-names.lst](top-vulnerable-subdomain-names.lst)
