# Project Resonance Wave 1 - Subdomain Takeovers

> Blog: https://redhuntlabs.com/blog/project-resonance-wave-1

Our first wave was a research on subdomain takeovers or more precisely misconfigured CNAME records. We are releasing a dataset of top subdomain names that we found vulnerable to takeover.

Dataset(s):
- [top-vulnerable-subdomain-names.lst](top-vulnerable-subdomain-names.lst)
